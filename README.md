# Workplace Management Toolbox

WMT ia a project made by [Dawid Rokita](https://github.com/DawidRokita), [StanisÅ‚aw Lisek](https://github.com/SL20032) and [Mateusz Goik](https://github.com/Gojodzojo) which took second place in 2022 edition of [Bit Festival Hackathon](https://bit.bestgliwice.pl/) ðŸ¥ˆ.

This is a tool for managing reservations of facilities such as offices, sport fields or parking spaces. It is not only a web application, but a whole system that enables efficient use of the infrastructure.

## The genesis of the project

The pandemic has forced company presidents to make extensive changes in the organization of work. Many of these solutions are still used today. One of them is a system in which the employer employs more employees than he can fit in his offices, because many of them work remotely. Our application is designed to help manage these types of facilities and enable them to be booked by individual users.

## The goal of this project

Our goal is to use space more efficiently by dynamically assigning it to users. This saves resources available in limited quantities.
Thanks to automation solutions, the comfort of using the facilities is also increased.

## How this system works

First, you must create a new account in the web app. After logging in, you can pick a date and choose which particular office you want to reserve.

When the day of your reservation comes, you will notice that the screen on the device next to the door displays your id. To enter the office you can use a fingerprint reader on the device (on the hackathon we did not have a fingerpint reader, but we used a button to imitate it). As soon as you authorize your entry, a computer in the office will automatically launch applications specified in a predefined list, so you can get to work right away.
